# form-validation
Form validation for text, email, password

The code uses event listeners to detect when the submit button is clicked and calls a function to validate the input fields. The input fields include the username, email, password, and confirm password.

The code defines functions to set error messages and success messages on the input fields. If an input field is empty or contains an invalid value, the setError function is called to display an error message and highlight the input field. Otherwise, the setSuccess function is called to remove any error message and highlight the input field as successful.

The code also defines a function to validate the email input field. The function checks whether the email input contains "@gmail.com" and returns true if it does.

Overall, this code provides a basic framework for validating input fields on a form and can be adapted for other forms and input types.
